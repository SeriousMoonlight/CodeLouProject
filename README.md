        INTRODUCTION
------------------------------

This website was built for a Home Renovation Upstart for long time extended family members. 
In a stroke of inspiration, this is what I decided upon doing as a first venture into coding and what I chose to do for my final project for the Code Louisville program.
There are MANY things I would do differently now but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out as a first attempt and helped me build a bit more self-confidence seeing what I
learned produce a tangible result.

------------------------------
        WHAT IS IT?
------------------------------

A prototype business website built with mobile and desktop layouts in mind. It's a simple yet concise site with a banner, different sections to browse such as a gallery, contact
form and a small bit of information about what services are available and who runs the show. It's pretty well optimized as well.
This also serves as the final project of my first semester in Code Louisville. I was required to create a project containing:

- 1 CSS Feature
- 1 JavaScript Feature
- 1 Additional JavaScript/CSS Feature of my choosing
- A minimum of 2 media queries that make some sort of visible changes to the layout of the project
- A minimum of 5 GitHub Commits to the Project repository using Git
- A README file (You're looking at that one right now. How;s that for meta?)

------------------------------
  WHAT FEATURES ARE INCLUDED?
------------------------------

- The cards on the homepage rearrange for mobile and desktop layouts (CSS/Media Query)
- The gallery and the caption cards describing the images rearrange themselves from a 4 column/2 row spread when in Desktop and uses stacked columns for mobile devices.
  The images can also be clicked on for better viewing in a separate tab (CSS/Media Query)
- Clickable button tabs that that hide/show specific sections of the site and realign for both mobile and desktop layouts. (JavaScript/Media Query)
- Contact Form that while inactive, will at the very least provide a personalized response with your name in the Name Entry Field as an alert message. (JavaScript)
- More than 5 commits to the project repository using GitBash were made. (Fun fact: The first commit took 2 hours to troubleshoot. Now it takes 2 minutes to make a push!)
- Whole site can be navigated with the keyboard which is a small consideration for accessibility 
  (Back to top link available at the bottom of the page for easier navigation back to top tabs as well)

------------------------------
           CONTENT
------------------------------

- A home page with a banner with a mission statement, about us and insight on the crew and what services are available with some jazzed up cards with dimmed background images
for easier to read text. 
- A sample gallery featuring some before and after pictures of some of the amazing work my dudes do!
- A simple contact form for inquiries.
- Back to Top button at the bottom for some ompany name and copyright "watermark"

        AUTHOR NOTES
-------------------------------

This was a huge learning lesson from me and to be honest I'd probably remake this from scratch but I'm happy with how it turned out.
(In fact I would rebuild the site with CSS Grid in mind from the start and include a proper company logo with some animated or 
changing images for the column images as well as more interactive and better optimized gallery).
The site changed drastically over the course of the program. I was genuinely too embarassed to push my first commit with how bad it looked but I'm also amazed by how much
it changed as I troubleshooted my issues and implementing the various things I learned.
